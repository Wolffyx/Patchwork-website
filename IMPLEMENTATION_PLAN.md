## Analysis Requirements
Before implementing, analyze the following:
1. Identify all files that need to be modified
2. List any new files that need to be created
3. Check for existing patterns in the codebase to follow
4. Identify any dependencies or related components

## Implementation Steps
1. **Preparation**
   - Review existing code structure
   - Identify integration points

2. **Core Changes**
   - Implement the main functionality
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions

3. **Integration**
   - Wire up new components
   - Update any necessary imports/exports

4. **Testing**
   - Add or update tests as needed
   - Verify existing tests still pass

## Verification
- Lint: `pnpm lint`
- Test: `pnpm test`
- Build: `pnpm build`

## Allowed Commands
- pnpm install
- pnpm lint
- pnpm test
- pnpm build

## Forbidden Paths
- .github/workflows/
- .gitlab-ci.yml

## Important Constraints
- Only use these commands: pnpm install, pnpm lint, pnpm test, pnpm build
- Do NOT modify these paths: .github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml
- Working directory: D:\Projects\Typescript\React\Patchwork-website-worktrees\github-23-fix-download-buttons-with-the-right-repo-release
- Repo root: D:\Projects\Typescript\React\Patchwork-website
- After implementation, run the verification commands if they exist

## Verification Commands
- Lint: pnpm lint
- Test: pnpm test
- Build: pnpm build
