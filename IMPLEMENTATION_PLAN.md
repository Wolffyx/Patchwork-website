## Approach
1. Analyze the requirements
2. Identify files to modify
3. Implement changes
4. Run verification commands
5. Commit and push

## Commands to Run
- pnpm install
- pnpm lint
- pnpm test
- pnpm build

## Important Constraints
- Only use these commands: pnpm install, pnpm lint, pnpm test, pnpm build
- Do NOT modify these paths: .github/workflows/, .gitlab-ci.yml
- Working directory: D:\Projects\Typescript\React\Patchwork-website-worktrees\github-23-fix-download-buttons-with-the-right-repo-release
- Repo root: D:\Projects\Typescript\React\Patchwork-website
- After implementation, run the verification commands if they exist

## Verification Commands
- Lint: pnpm lint
- Test: pnpm test
- Build: pnpm build
